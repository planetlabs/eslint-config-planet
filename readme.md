## eslint-config-planet

This package provides shareable [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) configurations for JavaScript projects that conform with Planet Labs' lint configurations.

### Installation

To make use of this config, install ESLint and this package as a development dependency of your project:

    npm install eslint eslint-config-planet --save-dev

Next, create a `.eslintrc` file at the root of your project.  At a minimum, this config file must include an `extends` member:

```json
{
  "extends": "planet"
}
```

See the ESLint [configuration guide](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring) for details on additional configuration options.  Any rules configured in your `.eslintrc` file will override those provided by the `eslint-config-planet` package.

### Profiles

The `eslint-config-planet` package includes a number of ESLint configuration profiles for different types of projects.

#### `planet` (base config)

The "base" config is suitable for Node projects or browser-based projects using a CommonJS module loader (e.g. [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) or [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)).

Example `.eslintrc`:
```json
{
  "extends": "planet"
}
```

#### `planet/react`

The `planet/react` config is suitable for projects using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).  This extends the base config to include the React plugin, enable JSX parsing, and run React specific rules.  To use this profile, you'll need to install the `eslint-plugin-react` package:

    npm install eslint-plugin-react --save-dev

Then your minimal `.eslintrc` would look like this:
```json
{
  "extends": "planet/react"
}
```
